# New Zealand Walks API

This repository reflects the successful completion of a Udemy course, where I've gained proficiency in creating an ASP.NET Core Web API, mastered the use of Entity Framework Core and SQL Server for data management, and implemented strong Authentication and Authorization mechanismsâ€”all within the framework of .NET 7. Explore this repository to leverage the knowledge and skills acquired during the course.

## API Objectives:

- Provide access to information about various walking trails and paths in New Zealand.
- Enable users to search, filter, and retrieve details about specific walks.
- Allow users to create, update, and delete walk-related data.
- Ensure data security and user authentication through JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Support image upload for walk-related images.
- Implement advanced functionality and performance optimizations.
- Enable API versioning to manage and maintain backward compatibility.
- Facilitate the consumption of the API by client applications.
- Offer deployment to Microsoft Azure for public accessibility.
